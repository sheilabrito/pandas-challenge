# District-wide Standardized Test Results Written Report

In this exercise we have analyzed students standardized test results for math and reading section, and for overall passing students, for both district and charter schools, and regarding school budgets.

When seeing metrics like % Overall Passing which calculates the percentage of students that pass both the math and reading categories, we can see in Figure 1 that district schools have the lowest percent overall passing, Rodriguez High School being the lowest with almost 53% Overall Passing. On the other hand, we can see in Figure 2 that charter schools had the higher percentage overall passing, Cabrera High School having the highest percentage at 91.33%. However, Figure 3 tells us that if we only differentiate the schools by size, we can see that small and medium perform similarly at around 90% overall passing but when we get to a large school size (meaning between 200 to 5000 students), the percentage largely drops to 58.33%.
In Figure 4 we can see that if we focus on metrics like school budget, specifically school budget per student, schools with a budget per student lower than $585 has both a higher percentage of students passing math and passing reading than schools with higher budgets. It is also valuable to mention that the percentage of students passing reading drops only from 96.6% to 81.1%, a difference of 15.5%, while the percentage of students passing math decreases from 93.5% to 66.2%, a difference of 27.3%.

In conclusion we can see that district and charter schools perform significantly different but this difference could be accounted to the school sizes rather than the type of school and thus a deeper analysis is to be done regarding this topic. Regarding the results by school budget, we can see that schools with budgets lower than $585 per student outperform schools with higher budgets hinting that low score issues come from another factor that is not investment on students. Also, as the budget per student increases, math scores decrease more significantly than reading scores showing that math education is more sensible to an increase of budget than reading.
